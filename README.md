This is a small project to simplify the workflow of taking one file with a text of a song and a translation of the song and splitting it.
This makes it easier to work with lyric translations in ProPresenter and is planned to be used in PyPresenter.

# Requierments
- Python

# TODO:

- Auto Translation with Google API
- further customisation of the paths for files
