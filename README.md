# LyricSplit
---
This is a small project to simplify the workflow of taking one file with a text of a song and a translation of the song and splitting it.
This should have made it easier to work with lyric translations in ProPresenter. It does not, do not use this for Propresenter. The selection of paths for the linking to files is terrible.
This Project still has relevanz though: I am planning to use it for PyPresenter. PyPresenter could in therory do this by itself, what would be more practical. Maybe some code will be implemented in the future. This project is still searching for a usecase

# Requierments
- Python

# TODO:

- Auto Translation with Google API
- further customisation of the paths for files
